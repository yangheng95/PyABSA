Our server paid little attention to refilling our drinks, the runners brought the entrees out less than 1 minute after the appetizer, the server delivered another $T$'s bill to us before we had even had entrees, and my partner's entree has a very noticable hair on his plate.

The food had a somewhat elevated price tag but but fair considering the Nobu origin - The cocktails highly recommended including the spide and lobster roll - we were well plated and did not encounter any arragance from the $T$ - maybe the other student reviewers are used to cafeteria service.

Just expect to wait a good twenty minutes before they take your order (even when the restaurant is half empty), you'll have to ask at least 5 $T$ and a manager for coffee before they bring it to you and when they bring your orders out wrong, expect the manager to side with the chef and not you.
